# Tailwind CSS Learning Project
This project was created to practice Tailwind CSS by replicating a UI design. I followed a tutorial to understand core Tailwind concepts, including flexbox, grid, and various CSS properties. Although this was my first time using Tailwind, this experience has built a foundation I plan to apply in future projects.

## Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to learn Tailwind CSS and develop a responsive, clean UI.

## Live Demo
The project is live at: https://hemanthraja7.github.io/Landing-Page_tailwind/

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies

Install all necessary node modules:

Copy code:

npm install

Compile Tailwind CSS

Run the following command in the terminal to compile the Tailwind CSS:

Copy code:

npx tailwindcss -i ./style.css -o ./output.css --watch

Launch with Live Server

Open the project through Live Server (make sure to install the Live Server extension in your code editor).

## Future Plans

With this foundational knowledge, I hope to undertake more projects and improve my Tailwind CSS skills.
